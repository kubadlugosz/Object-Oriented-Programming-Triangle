# Object-Oriented-Programming-Triangle
Creates a Python class Triangle. Each instance of this class takes 6 values Ax,Ay,Bx,By,Cx,Cy as arguments
that represent the (x,y) coordinates for three points A, B, and C. In addition, overload the str() function
so that we can print the triangle as "Triangle((Ax,Ay),(Bx,By),(Cx,Cy))" and create the following methods: Area,
which returns the area of a triangle, Perimeter, which returns the perimeter of a triangle, Barycenter, which returns
the center of a triangle, LongestSide, which returns the length of the longest side in the triangle, and IsRightTriangle,
which returns True if a triangle is a right triangle or False if it is not a right triangle.
